            <strong><sup>*</sup>Two thoughts</strong> on constructors
            in the context of testing:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If multiple constructors
                are complicating the testing process,
                we might consider eliminating
                some of the constructors.
                We have to balance convenience
                to the developer 
                with the cost of development and maintenance.
                Consider:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How often are developers
                        going use a given constructor?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How much convenience 
                        do developers derive 
                        from all those constructors?
                        On this topic let's acknowledge that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                All those constructors
                                might reduce development time
                                significantly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If instantiating a particular class
                                entails a complex calculation
                                for a parameter,
                                multiple constructors 
                                can be helpful in confining the calculation
                                to a single place (the constructor)
                                rather than requiring the developer
                                to perform the calculation.
                                This would reduce the complexity of the code,
                                leading to a product that is easier 
                                to maintain and enhance.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How difficult will it be
                        to write a unit test
                        for a particular constructer?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What impact does unit test development
                        have on the overall development schedule?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
