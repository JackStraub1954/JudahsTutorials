’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!”
</p>
<p class="odd">
He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood awhile in thought.
</p>
<p class="even">
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burbled as it came!
</p>
<p class="odd">
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went galumphing back.
</p>
<p class="even">
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chortled in his joy.
</p>
<p class="odd">
 ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.
