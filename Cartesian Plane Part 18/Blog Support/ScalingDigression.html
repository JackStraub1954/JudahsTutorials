Digression: Image Scaling
</p>
<p>
We've already seen that <em>Tess4J</em>
can produce less-than-perfect results
when extracting text from an image.
One way to improve the reults
is by <em>scaling</em> the image.
</p>
<p>
When we scale an image
we make it larger or smaller;
we do this by applying a <em>scale factor,</em>
a percentage by which
the inmage size is to be changed.
Scaling can be applied <em>uniformly,</em>
by applying the same scale factor
to the width a height of an image,
or <em>non-uniformly,</em>>
by changing the width by one scale factor
and the height by another.
Scaling can be applied
to <em>vector</em> images
or <em>raster</em> images.
If you're interested in a discussion
of the two types of images,
see the references below.
In our unit test for <em>GraphManager</em>
we will be dealing excusively
with <em>BufferedImages</em> which are rasters.
</p>
<p>
We talked about rasters in an earlier lesson.
A raster is a two-dimensional array of integers
where each integer determines the color 
of the corresponding pixel in a picture.
Since you can't change the size of a pixel,
scaling-up and image entails adding pixels,
while scaling-down means subtracting pixels.
Now the question becomes: 
how do you know which pixels to add or subtract?
There are a variety of algorithms
for making this choice;
for a general discussion of scaling algorithms,

The documentation for <em>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</em> 
says that two maps are equal if
"...the two maps represent the same mappings. 
More formally, two maps m1 and m2 
represent the same mappings if 
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())</span>."
Which leads to a discussion of <em>Sets</em>.
