<strong>Digression: <em>equals</em> and <em>hashCode</em> for <em>Maps</em> and <em>Sets</em>: </strong>
In the above code
we test corresponding <em>LinePropertySets</em> for equality
by comparing the maps that contain them:<br>
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this.linePropertySetMap.equals( that.linePropertySetMap );</span><br>
This leads us to a discussion
of how <em>Maps</em>
(and subsequently <em>Sets</em>)
are compared for equality.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for <em>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</em> 
says that two maps are equal if
"...the two maps represent the same mappings. 
More formally, two maps m1 and m2 
represent the same mappings if 
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())</span>."
Which leads to a discussion of <em>Sets</em>.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for <em>Set&lt;E&gt;</em> 
says the equals
"[returns] true if the specified object is also a set, the two sets have the same size, and every member of the specified set is contained in this set."
Then there's a qualification:
"Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set elements. The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object is changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is an element in the set."
