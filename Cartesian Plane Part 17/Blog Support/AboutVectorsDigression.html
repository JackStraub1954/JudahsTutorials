<strong>Digression: About <em>Vectors</em>:</strong>
This discussion is present
because the <em>JTable</em> maakes frequent reference
to the <em>Vector</em> class.
We're not going to be using <em>Vectors</em>
in our project.
So if you already know what a vector is,
or if you don't care, 
you can skip the following paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
For our purposes
a <em>Vector</em> is functionally equivalent
to an <em>ArrayList</em>.
In fact, <em>Vector</em>,
introduced in Java 1.0,
is a direct ancestor of 
<em>ArrayList</em>, which was introduced in Java 1.2.
The main advantage of a <em>Vector</em>
over an <em>ArrayList</em>
is that <em>Vectors</em> are thread-safe.
In the context of the <em>JTable</em> API
<em>Vector</em> is a substutute for <em>Object[]</em>
in the same way 
that an <em>ArrayList</em> can be substituted
for an <em>Object[]</em>.
As a an alternative to a two-dimensional <em>Object</em> array <em>Object[][]</em>
we can typically use a <em>Vector</em> of <em>Vectors</em>,
as in the overloaded constructors:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 2em;">JTable(Object[][] rowData, Object[] columnNames)
JTable(Vector&lt;? extends Vector&lt;?>> rowData, Vector&lt;?> columnNames)</pre>
<p>
A final note about <em>Vectors</em>: 
there are still places in the <em>JTable</em> API
that use pre-generic declarations of <em>Vector</em>,
such as the declaration of <em>getDataVector()</em>
in the <em>DefaultTableModel</em> class:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 2em;">Vector&lt;Vector> getDataVector()</pre>
<p>
This can be very annoying
when it comes to trying
to resolve compiler warnings
such as 
"Vector is a raw type. References to generic type Vector&lt;E> should be parameterized".
