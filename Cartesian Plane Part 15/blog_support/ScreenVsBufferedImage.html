<sup>*</sup><strong>Note:</strong>
The distinction between
a <em>hardware</em> monitor
and its "<em>software</em> analog"
is a huge one.
A monitor
is an engineering marvel,
with at least
one dedicated processor
and its own memory,
incorporating all the magic
engineers have learned
over the last 50+ years
to bring you
an extraordinarily clear, crisp picture
of unmatched quality.
A <em>BufferedImage</em>
is a dumb integer array.
