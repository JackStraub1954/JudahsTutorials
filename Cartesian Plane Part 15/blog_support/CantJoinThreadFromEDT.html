    <strong>About Running the Dialog Thread:</strong>
    This operation
    will execute
    just like similar ones
    we've seen in the past:
    the unit test method
    gets the thread object,
    configures and dimisses the dialog,
    and waits for
    the thread to terminate
    (it <em>joins</em> the dialog thread).
    Also a great deal of the test
    will have to be executed
    on the EDT;
    but we have to be careful
    <em>not</em> to join the dialog thread
    while we're running on the EDT.
    That's because the EDT
    is processing the dialog dismissal;
    joining the dialog thread
    from the EDT
    would suspend the EDT
    while waiting for the EDT
    to finish its work...
    which it can't do while
    it's suspended.
    Multithreaded programming 
    can be tricky.
