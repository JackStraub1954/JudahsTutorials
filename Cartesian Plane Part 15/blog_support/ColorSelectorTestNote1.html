<strong>Note:</strong>
The <em>showDialog()</em> method
consists of a single line of code,
and is present
for aesthetic purposes.
Because it's a single line of code
many programmers
are going to want
to integrate it
into the calling method,
<em>showColorSelector()</em>.
This can be done,
but it's kind of ugly:
</p>
<pre style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 90%; margin-left:3em;">Thread  thread  = new Thread( 
    () -> GUIUtils.schedEDTAndWait(
        () -> selectedColor = colorSelector.showDialog()
    )
);</pre>
<p>
In my opinion
the improved readability
is worth the extra
bit of code.
