Digression: Buttons with Images
</p>
<img src="../images/ButtonIcons.png" alt="ButtonIcons.png" style="float: right; width: 20%; height: auto;">
<p>
We are not
going to be 
putting images 
on our buttons
in this project,
but,
in case you're interested in doing so,
here is a quick discussion
of how to do it.
</p>
<p>
To add an image
to a component,
first it has to be
formatted as an <em>icon</em>.
The quickest way
is to use 
the <em>ImageIcon(String path)</em> constructor,
where <em>path</em> is the path
to an image file
in any of the common formats:<br>
<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', 'Courier New', monospace;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon( "images/Forward.png" );<br>
</span>
However, this constructor
won't tell us
whether or not
the image indicated by the path
was found
and correctly loaded.
I prefer to create a <em>BufferedImage</em> first,
then use that to create the icon.
The GUI pictured at right
was created using
application <em>ButtonImageDemo1</em>
in the project sandbox;
the icons in the GUI
were formulated using:
</p>
<pre style="font-family: 'Lucida Console', 'Courier New', monospace; padding-left:3em;">
private ImageIcon getImageIcon( String path )
{
    File        file    = new File( path );
    ImageIcon   icon    = null;
    try
    {
        BufferedImage   image   = ImageIO.read( file );
        icon = new ImageIcon( image );
    }
    catch ( IOException exc )
    {
        exc.printStackTrace();
        System.exit( 1 );
    }
    return icon;
}</pre>
<p>
If <em>ImageIO.read</em> fails
it will throw an IOException
which we can then catch.
